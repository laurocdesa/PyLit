PyLit3
******

`Literate Programming`_ with reStructuredText_ compatible with Python 3.

This is a project forked from http://github.com/gmilde/PyLit/raw/master/pylit.py

An attempt to make Pylit compatible with Python 3.

.. epigraph::

   The idea is that you do not document programs (after the fact), but
   write documents that *contain* the programs.
   
   -- John Max Skaller

What is it
  PyLit (Python Literate) provides a plain but efficient tool for
  literate programming: a `bidirectional text/code converter`.

Install
  As `PyLit` is a pure Python module, installation is straightforward: 
  Put `pylit.py`_ in Python's `Module Search Path`_.

.. _pylit.py: http://github.com/gmilde/PyLit/raw/master/pylit.py

Documentation
  See http://pylit.berlios.de 
  
  .. note:: The previous host of the PyLit project, berlios.de will close at
     the end of 2011. For the transition period, some links might not work.
